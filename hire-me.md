# Hire me!

I'd love to continue applying and improving the skills for roles I've already done, but I'm also open to trying new things.
If you want to know who I am, [you can read my CV](/cv), and if you want to know what I can do for you, continue reading here:

## I'm confident in my ability to:

### Adapt

Over the years, I've collected many proven approaches to work and technology into my toolbox that I can always fall back on.
Yet, I'm continuously learning new things and staying on top of modern trends to evaluate what to explore next.

When evaluating a technology, I always consider its total cost of ownership, which allowed me to avoid many fads that would otherwise have cost the project time, money, and opportunity.
I usually stay with the project long enough to see the fruits of my work, so if I make a mistake in my evaluation, I can learn from it, fix it, and avoid repeating it.

### Build a product

When building a product, I start with a why and do my best to understand the business needs and priorities while ensuring the same is true for the rest of the team.
I do my best work paired with a skilled product manager who truly focuses on customer needs and product idea validation.
In turn, I'll free their hands by partially or fully taking on project management, helping brainstorm ways to validate prototypes, and making sure whatever we want to build is feasible within the constraints.

When leading a team, I advocate for seeking out leading business metrics, continuous delivery, and [true agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) with bare minimum ceremonies, which ensures stakeholders and customers can benefit from the progress frequently.
This way, the team can rapidly course-correct if the metrics show new findings instead of being locked into waterfall-like year-long plans that almost always fail.

### Build and lead a team

I've proven multiple times that I can interview, hire, onboard, and effectively engage with team members, even when starting from zero.
I don't believe in manipulating and exploiting people - I build happy and engaged teams with transparency, trust, and zero-bullshit policy.

I lead by example when promoting DevSecOps culture, where the team developing the service is responsible for its availability, not some 3rd-party that won't be able to fix outages if something unexpected happens.
When problems occur, I engage in blameless root-cause analysis and focus on regression prevention.

### Develop in Java or Kotlin

My specialization is web-based application development on Spring Boot paired with Hibernate ORM, so I prefer to stay close to their ecosystem to produce predictable results.
But I'm open to exploring new paths, as I've already worked for ~10 years with PHP, and I also have a few years with Python and TypeScript under my belt.

### Improve developer experience (DevEx)

I greatly enjoy implementing practices and technologies that serve as a multiplier for effectiveness and efficiency, either by providing a solution for a common sub-problem or by creating an environment where a whole category of problems is prevented entirely.
These could be shared services, libraries, observability tools, custom static analysis rules, reusable build components, or just tuning the performance of some system component.

### Put the "Engineering" into "Data Engineering"

I'm neither a data scientist nor a statistics expert, but I know a thing or two about software development best practices.
I've seen brilliant people produce business-critical reports that I would struggle with, only to start showing nonsense or break completely a few weeks later because somebody touched something without knowing all the consequences.
If that sounds familiar, I can implement a cure for you through my beloved buzzwords - data mesh, data lineage, and DevEx.

### Tackle legacy

I'll gladly put on a hazmat suit and jump head-first into the void of despair that has been causing your engineers to run away from your company.
I love to find safe ways to modernize a project so that it can be a joy to work on it again without having to throw it away and start from scratch.
